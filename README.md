# Fragment-Based-V-SYNTHES
This repository contains code for selecting substructure-similar fragments from the MEL REAL Enamine Space to implement the fragment growth strategy for lead discovery in fragment-based drug discovery. This approach was presented at the Cambridge Healthtech Instituteâ€™s 19th Annual Drug Discovery Conference on April 2-3, 2024, in San Diego.
